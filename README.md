# Yamba
PROYECTO COLABORATIVO DE COMPUTACIÓN MÓVIL

We call it Yamba, which stands for Yet Another Micro Blogging App. Yamba lets a user 
connect to a cloud web service, pull down friends’ statuses, and update his own status.
Yamba covers most of the main Android building blocks in a natural way. As such, it’s
a great sample application to illustrate both how various components work individually
and how they fit together. Services such as Twitter are more or less familiar to most
people, so the features of the application do not require much explanation.
